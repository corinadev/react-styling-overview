React component styling libraries overview
===

List of component styling libraries with live information for each regarding:
* number of downloads from NPM
* number of stargazers on Github
* date created

Aims to make it easier to see how popular each library is, how many projects use it.

To start, just run:

```
yarn start
```

The list of libraries to show is defined manually in `src\data\libraries.json`.
The information for each is retrieved by querying the NPM registry API and Github API at runtime.
